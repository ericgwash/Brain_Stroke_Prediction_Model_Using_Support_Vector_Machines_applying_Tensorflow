# Brain_Stroke_Prediction_Model_Using_Support_Vector_Machines_applying_Tensorflow

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths, and third leading cause of disability.

Brain Stroke happens when there is a blockage in the blood circulation in the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain breaks and leaks. The burst or blockage prevents blood and oxygen reaching the brain tissue leading to the death of brain cells. This sometimes results in physical, cognitive and mental disabilities.

80% of strokes are preventable. Our project aims at evaluating the factors that may increase the chances of someone getting a stroke and building a model that can accurately predict these chances. This will help many people know the risk factors of getting a stroke and how to prevent or avoid such risks and in return, many lives will be saved.

## Defining the Question

### Specifying the Question

What is the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke?

## Defining the Metric for Success

This research will be considered solvent when we are able to predict the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke with a model with a precision score of 90% and above.

##Understanding the context

A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.

Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.

The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.

## Research Objectives

### Main Objective
To predict the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke.

### Specific Objectives
1. To find the relationship between age, BMI, glucose level and getting a stroke
2. To find out if hypertension and heart disease influences the likelyhood of getting a stroke
3. To establish whether patient's who've ever married are more likely to get a stroke than those who have never married
4. To identify the correlation between a patient's smoking status, place of residence and type of occupation and stroke
5. Recording the Experimental Design
6. Defining the research question
7. Load data and preview preliminary characteristics of the dataset
8. Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset
9. Perform exploratory data analysis
10. Implement the solution
11. Challenging the solution

## Relevance of the data

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
